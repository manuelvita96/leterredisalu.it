                      It is now undeniable how much social networks play a fundamental role in the path of a commercial activity: both from the point of view of visibility of the same and of the dynamics of reputation and growth of the brand.
                      If you don't just create one and leave things to chance, posting meaningless photos albeit related to your business, then there are many advantages linked to a skilful and adequate use of a corporate social account.
                      We at<b>The Terre di Salu</b> do not like to leave things to chance and for us it is important to take care of our social accounts, among these the one we prefer is undoubtedly Instagram.
                      <br>
                      So what are the goals we set ourselves through our social accounts?
                      <br><br>
                      The first is undoubtedly to <i>create</i> and <i>consolidate</i> contacts with our existing customers and collaborators. But what we want is to create leads with potential customers and give birth to <i>new business opportunities</i>, yes because we love new challenges and we are open to considering the potential job opportunities with anyone who wishes.
                      We create tailor-made content for an <i>unlimited and extended audience</i>, which is why our posts are sometimes studied in three different languages: Italian, English and Chinese. Our training as a Content Creator and Storytelling allows us to educate our audience through informative and promotional content.
                      Furthermore, for us the <i>care of our customers</i> is fundamental, which is why we use our social accounts not only as a showcase but also as a means of customer service, all our customers can ask for information or support via social networks and we will respond in a very short time.
                      <br><br>
                      <b>The Terre di Salu</b> are an absolutely social reality.
                      We are there and you? Click on the brand below and <i>follow us</i> on our instagram account, experience the wonderful Terre di Salu with us!
